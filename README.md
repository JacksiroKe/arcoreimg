[arcoreimg](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/c/augmented-images/arcoreimg)  is a command line tool that takes a set of reference images and generates an image database file. This tool is available in the [ARCore SDK for Android](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases) and is for only Android and Android NDK developers. It is built into the Unity SDK and ARCore Unreal plugin. However if you dont like doing command line stuff when building an android app then this will do you good for Windows.
